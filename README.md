- ~~[DONE] Color reading. Currently getting blue/black instead of red. ~~
- ~~[DONE-optimize?] Fix 3D Visualization Scaling~~
- ~~[DONE] Make sure all variables are linked to map input variables and not constants on final working version~~
- ~~[DONE-double_check_variations_for_scaling] Switch to 150x150 map with 7x7 buildings~~
