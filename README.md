# MapImage2Robot


## Current Todo: 

- [DONE - optimize?] Fix 3D Visualization Scaling
- Make sure all variables are linked to map input variables and not constants on final working version
- [DONE - double check variations for scaling] Switch to 150x150 map with 7x7 buildings
- Add exlusion zone in the middle and change input maps accordingly after getting exact zone coords from Zeynep
- Add OCR to initial image processing
